Unfortunately, it is Windows only and comes with a significant price tag. Without a great deal of customization, you will be hard-pressed to find a comparable solution. If you have the budget and run a heterogeneous shop, I can strongly recommend using this piece of software. Also, their IPAM and NetFlow tools are quite solid, as well.</p>\n\n<p>That said, I know of three pieces of software that run on Linux and might give you a start dynamically mapping your network: <a href=\"http://cheops-ng.sourceforge.net/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Cheops</a>, <a href=\"https://www.manageengine.com/network-performance-management.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OPManager</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.opennms.org/get-opennms/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OpenNMS</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I would also recommend looking at the <a href=\"http://www.slac.stanford.edu/xorg/nmtf/nmtf-tools.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SLAC page</a> to see if there are any more recent developments in the network management space.</p>\n\n<p>The following applications are listed, in ascending order, in terms of cost, complexity, and feature-sets. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Cheops</strong></p>\n\n<p>Cheops is a free network mapping solution that will go out and discover and graphically display the servers and network nodes for you. It is old, and possibly no longer under development. But, it is a simple tool to use for network discovery.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://cheops-ng.sourceforge.net/images/cheops.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://cheops-ng.sourceforge.net/images/cheops.jpg</a></p>\n\n<p>You can download Cheops, <a href=\"http://cheops-ng.sourceforge.net/download.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>OpenNMS</strong></p>\n\n<p>OpenNMS is able to do network discovery, event management, and performance management. It is available as a .deb package as well.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.opennms.org/w/images/a/a9/Example.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.opennms.org/w/images/a/a9/Example.jpg</a></p>\n\n<p>Core features:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Automatic Layer-2 and Layer-3 link discovery</li>\n<li>Automatic Network / Node Discovery and Provisioning</li>\n<li>Automatic Service Discovery and Provisioning</li>\n<li>IPv6 support throughout (new)</li>\n<li>Manual Node and Service Provisioning Requisitions</li>\n<li>Path Outage support</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.opennms.org/wiki/Features_List\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Feature list</a></p>\n\n<p>OpenNMS <a href=\"http://www.opennms.org/get-opennms/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">download</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.opennms.org/wiki/Installation:Debian\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Installation instructions</a> for deb/apt-get.</p>\n\n<p><strong>OPManager</strong></p>\n\n<p>OpManager, on the other hand, is a commercial tool. It has a similar feature-set of the SolarWinds solution. In my experience, it is very robust and customizable. That said, you will have to pay for it. It does run on Debian-based systems, though it is not custom-tailored for Ubuntu. YMMV.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.manageengine.com/network-monitoring/images/screenshot/network-mapping.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>In terms of network management functionality, it supports:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Availability and Uptime Monitoring</li>\n<li>Traffic and Utilization Monitoring</li>\n<li>Cisco Monitoring</li>\n<li>Network Device Health Monitoring\n(Router, Switch, Firewall, wireless access points)</li>\n<li>Network Mapping</li>\n<li>Custom Network Maps / Network Traffic Maps</li>\n<li>WAN RTT Monitoring</li>\n<li>Network Traffic Analysis (NetFlow, sFlow)</li>\n<li>VoIP Monitoring</li>\n<li>Network Configuration Management</li>\n<li>IP Address Management</li>\n<li>Switch Port Mapper</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For a full list of features, see:\n<a href=\"https://www.manageengine.com/network-monitoring/features.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n\n<p>You can download a free trial of OPManager <a href=\"https://www.manageengine.com/network-monitoring/download.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n\n<p>I would be very interested in hearing from others in regards to using a <strong>free</strong>, unified network management solution in Ubuntu that does not require in-house development and a great deal of care and feeding. </p>\n\n<p>In the mean time, when it's unreasonable to use OPManager, or OpenNMS, I will have to make due with my own custom Nagios/Cacti/SmokePing/Rancid/IPPlan solution for smaller networks.</p>\n",

So, for example in bash, you could do:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-bash prettyprint-override\"><code>#!/bin/bash\nfunction levenshtein {\n    if [ \"$#\" -ne \"2\" ]; then\n        echo \"Usage: $0 word1 word2\" &gt;&amp;2\n    elif [ \"${#1}\" -lt \"${#2}\" ]; then\n        levenshtein \"$2\" \"$1\"\n    else\n        local str1len=$((${#1}))\n        local str2len=$((${#2}))\n        local d i j\n        for i in $(seq 0 $(((str1len+1)*(str2len+1)))); do\n            d[i]=0\n        done\n        for i in $(seq 0 $((str1len))); do\n            d[$((i+0*str1len))]=$i\n        done\n        for j in $(seq 0 $((str2len))); do\n            d[$((0+j*(str1len+1)))]=$j\n        done\n\n        for j in $(seq 1 $((str2len))); do\n            for i in $(seq 1 $((str1len))); do\n                [ \"${1:i-1:1}\" = \"${2:j-1:1}\" ] &amp;&amp; local cost=0 || local cost=1\n                local del=$((d[(i-1)+str1len*j]+1))\n                local ins=$((d[i+str1len*(j-1)]+1))\n                local alt=$((d[(i-1)+str1len*(j-1)]+cost))\n                d[i+str1len*j]=$(echo -e \"$del\\n$ins\\n$alt\" | sort -n | head -1)\n            done\n        done\n        echo ${d[str1len+str1len*(str2len)]}\n    fi\n}\n\nwhile read str1; do\n        while read str2; do\n                lev=$(levenshtein \"$str1\" \"$str2\");\n                printf '%s / %s : %s\\n' \"$str1\" \"$str2\" \"$lev\"\n        done &lt; \"$2\"\ndone &lt; \"$1\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Save that as <code>~/bin/levenshtein.sh</code>, make it executable (<code>chmod a+x ~/bin/levenshtein.sh</code>) and run it on your two files. For example:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>$ cat fileA\nfoo\nzoo\nbar\nfob\nbaar\n$ cat fileB\nfoo\nloo\nbaar\nbob\ngaf\n$ a.sh fileA fileB\nfoo / foo : 0\nfoo / loo : 1\nfoo / baar : 4\nfoo / bob : 2\nfoo / gaf : 3\nzoo / foo : 1\nzoo / loo : 1\nzoo / baar : 4\nzoo / bob : 2\nzoo / gaf : 3\nbar / foo : 3\nbar / loo : 3\nbar / baar : 1\nbar / bob : 2\nbar / gaf : 2\nfob / foo : 1\nfob / loo : 2\nfob / baar : 4\nfob / bob : 1\nfob / gaf : 3\nbaar / foo : 4\nbaar / loo : 4\nbaar / baar : 0\nbaar / bob : 3\nbaar / gaf : 3\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That's fine for a few patterns but will get <em>very</em> slow for larger files. If that's an issue, try one of the implementations in other languages. For example Perl:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-perl prettyprint-override\"><code>#!/usr/bin/perl \nuse List::Util qw(min);\n\nsub levenshtein\n{\n    my ($str1, $str2) = @_;\n    my @ar1 = split //, $str1;\n    my @ar2 = split //, $str2;\n\n    my @dist;\n    $dist[$_][0] = $_ foreach (0 .. @ar1);\n    $dist[0][$_] = $_ foreach (0 .. @ar2);\n\n    foreach my $i (1 .. @ar1) {\n        foreach my $j (1 .. @ar2) {\n            my $cost = $ar1[$i - 1] eq $ar2[$j - 1] ? 0 : 1;\n            $dist[$i][$j] = min(\n                            $dist[$i - 1][$j] + 1, \n                            $dist[$i][$j - 1] + 1, \n                            $dist[$i - 1][$j - 1] + $cost\n                             );\n        }\n    }\n\n    return $dist[@ar1][@ar2];\n}\nopen(my $fh1, \"$ARGV[0]\");\nopen(my $fh2, \"$ARGV[1]\");\nchomp(my @strings1=&lt;$fh1&gt;);\nchomp(my @strings2=&lt;$fh2&gt;);\n\nforeach my $str1 (@strings1) {\n    foreach my $str2 (@strings2) {\n        my $lev=levenshtein($str1, $str2);\n        print \"$str1 / $str2 : $lev\\n\";\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As above, save the script as <code>~/bin/levenshtein.pl</code> and make it executable and run it with the two files as arguments:</p>\n\n<pre><code>~/bin/levenstein.pl fileA fileB\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Even in the very small files used here, the Perl approach is 10 times faster than the bash one:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ time levenshtein.sh fileA fileB &gt; /dev/null\n\nreal    0m0.965s\nuser    0m0.070s\nsys     0m0.057s\n\n$ time levenshtein.pl fileA fileB &gt; /dev/null\nreal    0m0.011s\nuser    0m0.010s\nsys     0m0.000s\n</code></pre>\n",

                "text": "<p>Yes, that's correct. Note that only root can run the shutdown command by default. So, if you have not done any tweaking with the permission of running the command just put the cron entry in the root user's cron (<code>sudo crontab -e</code>) or add the entry in <code>/etc/crontab</code> mentioning the user as root.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT (Regarding Anacron):</strong> Absolutely bad idea. generally anacron is used while you want to run a command daily but you are not sure whether your computer will be On or Off. So lets say you have added an anacron entry to run a command. Then if the computer is On anacron checks and runs the command, if the computer was Off on that specified time the instant you turn On the computer next time anacron will run that command. </p>\n\n<p>So, in a nutshell anacron is used while you are not sure your computer is gonna be On or Off. In your case you are shutting down the computer so if you put that to run by anacron your computer will be shut down by anacron if it was off and when you will turn it On after the specified time. </p>\n\n<p>Your command</p>\n\n<pre><code>30 7 * * * root start -q anacron || : 30 17 * * * root /sbin/shutdown -h now\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>means that run <code>30 7 * * * root start -q anacron</code> first, if that fails run <code>30 17 * * * root /sbin/shutdown -h now</code> makes no sense i think. Just add the entry in crontab and that'll do the job.</p>\n",

At the prompt asking “Guided” or “Manual” partitioning, choose “Manual”.</p>\n\n<p>At the partitioner:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Delete the partition table for the devices that will be used. This will delete everything on the selected device, so make sure that you have everything backed up.</li>\n<li>Create partitions for /boot (no more than 256MB is needed), /, /home and swap.

If you don't enter the password at POST the disk isn't exposed to the OS. From <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_ATA#HDD_passwords_and_security\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The disk lock is a built-in security feature in the disk. It is part\n  of the ATA specification, and thus not specific to any brand or\n  device. The disk lock can be enabled and disabled by sending special\n  ATA commands to the drive. If a disk is locked, it will refuse all\n  access until it is unlocked.</p>\n  \n  <p>A disk always has two passwords: A User password and a Master\n  password.</p>\n  \n  <p>A disk can be locked in two modes: High security mode or Maximum\n  security mode. In High security mode, the disk can be unlocked with\n  either the User or Master password. There is an attempt limit,\n  normally set to 5, after which the disk must be power cycled or\n  hard-reset before unlocking can be attempted again.</p>\n  \n  <p>In Maximum security mode, the disk can be unlocked only with the User\n  password. If the User password is not available, the only remaining\n  way to get at least the bare hardware back to a usable state is to\n  issue the SECURITY ERASE PREPARE command, immediately followed by\n  SECURITY ERASE UNIT. In Maximum security mode the SECURITY ERASE UNIT\n  command requires the Master password and will completely erase all\n  data on the disk. The operation is slow, it may take longer than half\n  an hour or more, depending on the size of the disk.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hard Disk imaging</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.clonezilla.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Clonezilla</a> is an great tool to image HDDs and partitions, but I don't know if it can generate images from encrypted disks, but you can certainly clone the whole disk using <a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/a/2725/65926\">dd</a>. A password locked HD won't be a problem since you'll unlock it prior image generation.</p>\n",

So I have to do it manually. Possibly if Ubuntu polishes and fixes the default installation method it may work in the future, as it was working by default in Ubuntu 13.04.</p>\n\n<p>I am connecting to the printer via USB. In a later version of this tutorial I will explain how to connect via LAN. </p>\n\n<p>I download these two files from the mentioned Brother's pages.</p>\n\n<pre><code>dcp8110dnlpr-3.0.0-1.i386.deb \ndcp8110dncupswrapper-3.0.0-1.i386.deb\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In theory I can choose to install either the CUPS one or the LPR one. But it seems that if you choose to install the CUPS one, you have to install first the LPR one and then the CUPS one. And this is what I am going to describe, how to install both in order to get the CUPS driver to work. I am choosing CUPS as it is a more modern system. </p>\n\n<p>Procedure: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Install Apparmor utils (with sudo agt-get install apparmor-utils\nor with the Ubuntu software centre)</p>\n\n<p>sudo apt-get install apparmor-utils</p></li>\n<li><p>Let's tell Apparmor (aa) not to complain (aa-complain) about CUPS\n(cupsd package)</p>\n\n<p>sudo aa-complain cupsd</p></li>\n<li><p>Let's create a directory necessary for the installation. But in my\ncase Ubuntu replied that the directory was already present.</p>\n\n<p>sudo mkdir /usr/share/cups/model</p></li>\n<li><p>Let's install the LPR driver (of course you need to navigate with\nthe command line to the folder where you have donwloaded the driver\nfile) (Quick tip: Use \"cd\" to navigate in the command line, example\n\"cd Documents\" to go to a subfolder called Documents inside your\npresent folder, or \"cd ..\" to go to an upper folder)</p>\n\n<p>sudo dpkg -i --force-all dcp8110dnlpr-3.0.0-1.i386.deb</p></li>\n<li><p>Install cupswrapper driver</p>\n\n<p>sudo dpkg -i --force-all dcp8110dncupswrapper-3.0.0-1.i386.deb</p></li>\n<li><p>Check if the LPR driver and cupswrapper driver are installed</p>\n\n<p>dpkg  -l  |  grep  Brother</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This is the output I get in my computer for this command:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ii  dcp8110dcupswrapper                       3.0.0-1                                 i386         Brother DCP-8110D CUPS wrapper driver\nii  dcp8110dncupswrapper                      3.0.0-1                                 i386         Brother DCP-8110DN CUPS wrapper driver\nii  dcp8110dnlpr                              3.0.0-1                                 i386         Brother DCP-8110DN LPR driver\nii  printer-driver-ptouch                     1.3-6                                   i386         printer driver Brother P-touch label printers\n</code></pre>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>I am connecting to the printer via USB.

Also this page has not appeared again:</p>\n\n<p>In my computer the printing works well. </p>\n\n<h2>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Scanning:</strong></p>\n\n<p>We need 2 files, the scanner driver (32bits or 64bits) and an extra file. </p>\n\n<p>Driver file name on July 2014. </p>\n\n<p>32 bits: <code>brscan4-0.4.2-3.i386.deb</code></p>\n\n<p>64 bits: <code>brscan4-0.4.2-3.amd64.deb</code></p>\n\n<p>Extra file name on July 2014:</p>\n\n<pre><code>brother-udev-rule-type1-1.0.0-1.all.deb\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>1) Getting the driver file</p>\n\n<p>You need a 32bit or 64bit version of the driver. \nYou can check you Linux version by typing on a terminal <code>uname -a</code></p>\n\n<p>This is the output of <code>uname -a</code> in a 32bits system: (notice i686 and/or i386)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Linux tommy 2.6.38-8-generic-pae #42-Ubuntu SMP Mon Apr 11\n  05:17:09 UTC 2011 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is the output of <code>uname -a</code> in a 64bits system: (notice x86_64)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Linux webserver 2.6.28-19-server #64-Ubuntu SMP Wed Aug 18 22:43:50\n  UTC 2010 x86_64 GNU/Linux</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>After you know if your system is 32bit or 64bit go to your printer's drivers page, accept their EULA, and download your driver. </p>\n\n<p>In July 2014 the driver names are respectively:</p>\n\n<p>32 bits: <code>brscan4-0.4.2-3.i386.deb</code></p>\n\n<p>64 bits: <code>brscan4-0.4.2-3.amd64.deb</code></p>\n\n<p>2) Getting the extra file:</p>\n\n<p>After you have downloaded your driver you will see in that page there is a procedure about how to install the driver, and in the 5th item of the description there is a link that says \"<code>Use your usb-connectrd scanner by a normal user</code>\", click on it, then you will be taken to another page with information about several linux distributions, for Ubuntu 10.10 to 13.10 (valid also for more recent ones, such as the current one now, 14.04) there is a link that says \"<code>1. Click here to download the file.(brother-udev-rule-type1-1.0.0-1.all.deb, ver.1.0.0-1, 2KB)</code>\" click on it and get the 'extra' file </p>\n\n<p><code>brother-udev-rule-type1-1.0.0-1.all.deb</code></p>\n\n<p>Now we have our two files, our driver file (32 bits or 64 bits) and the 'extra' file. We can now install the drivers.</p>\n\n<p>3) Prerequisite before installing the driver files: We need to be sure our computer has installed the two following files, a) <code>sane-utils</code> b) <code>tcsh</code> </p>\n\n<p>Install them via Ubuntu Software Centre or with the following command in a terminal:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo apt-get install sane-utils tcsh\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>4) Install the driver with your printer turned on and connected via USB. </p>\n\n<p>Open a terminal and go to the folder where you saved your driver files, and execute:</p>\n\n<p>For the 32bits version:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo dpkg -i --force-all brscan4-0.4.2-3.i386.deb\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For the 64bits version:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo dpkg -i --force-all brscan4-0.4.2-3.amd64.deb\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>5) Install the extra file so not only the superuser can use the scanner:</p>\n\n<pre><code>dpkg -i brother-udev-rule-type1-1.0.0-1.all.deb\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>6) Check if the scanner is installed by typing on a terminal:</p>\n\n<pre><code>dpkg -l | grep Brother\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The output in my computer for this command is: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>dpkg -l | grep Brother </p>\n  \n  <p>ii  brscan4           0.4.2-3                     i386         <strong>Brother Scanner Driver</strong><br>\n  ii  dcp8110dncupswrapper  3.0.0-1                 i386         Brother DCP-8110DN CUPS wrapper driver<br>\n  ii  dcp8110dnlpr 3.0.0-1                          i386         Brother DCP-8110DN LPR driver<br>\n  ii  printer-driver-ptouch 1.3-8                   i386         printer driver Brother P-touch label printers</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Restart the computer and check your scanning.

There is no objective answer I suppose. </p>\n\n<p>Of course you should certainly upgrade before the support ends and for 12.04 it means before April 2017. One reason to upgrade would be that as Ubuntu is coming to phones and tablets it must become more resource efficient. As people claim 13.04 delivers notable improvements in that sense. That means, it is likely to do the same tasks faster.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, if your not an enthusiast who just enjoys new things and don't care if they don't work then it makes sense to wait before moving to new release. After first few months there is hope that most critical bugs have been revealed and fixed. </p>\n\n<p>I am using 12.04 myself and really wondering whether it is worth the trouble of upgrading to 13.04. Even if you use the release upgrade feature it makes sense to make backups as things might go wrong (as you can read from various questions here) and the whole process takes time and effort. So maybe wait for 14.04 and upgrade next summer. </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand if your current system has any chronic problems you might want to try if those have been fixed in the newer release.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>EDIT: I upgraded to 13.04 and yes it is faster as everybody have been telling me.</p>\n",

                "text": "<h2>Bash Arithmetic</h2>\n\n<p>Another possible solution is to add a simple function for Bash's builtin arithmetic. Put this in your <code>.bashrc</code> file to try:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"lang-bsh prettyprint-override\"><code>=() {\n    echo \"$(($@))\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So now, you don't even need <code>$((...))</code> anymore, just <code>=</code> which seems natural enough.</p>\n\n<h3>Replacement</h3>\n\n<p>Another thing if you want to be even faster: you can make it replace <code>p</code> with <code>+</code> and <code>x</code> with <code>*</code>. This will work for that:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-bsh prettyprint-override\"><code>=() {\n    calc=\"${@//p/+}\"\n    calc=\"${calc//x/*}\"\n    echo \"$(($calc))\"\n}\n\n= 5 x 5  # Returns 25\n= 50p25  # Returns 75\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now you don't even need <kbd>Shift</kbd> anymore, the only thing is <code>=&nbsp;</code> in front of arithmetic.</p>\n\n<h3>Hexadecimal output</h3>\n\n<p>Output can be displayed in both decimal and hexadecimal, if so desired. (<strong>Note</strong>: using <code>x</code> substitution will conflict with the <code>0x...</code> hex syntax)</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-bsh prettyprint-override\"><code>=() {\n    answer=\"$(($@))\"\n    printf '%s' \"$answer\"\n    bc -l &lt;&lt;&lt; \"obase=16;ans=$answer;print \\\" (0x\\\",ans,\\\")\\\\n\\\"\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(uses Bash for arithmetic, but bc for final decimal to hex conversion)</p>\n\n<p>Example: </p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-bsh prettyprint-override\"><code>$ = 16 + 0x10\n272 (0x110)\n\n$ = 16**3 + 16**4\n69632 (0x11000)\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Using bc</h2>\n\n<p>If you want slightly more advanced calculations, you can pipe it to <code>bc</code> like so:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-bsh prettyprint-override\"><code>=() {\n    calc=\"${@//p/+}\"\n    calc=\"${calc//x/*}\"\n    bc -l &lt;&lt;&lt;\"scale=10;$calc\"\n}\n\n= 'sqrt(2)' # Returns 1.4142135623\n= '4*a(1)'  # Returns pi (3.1415926532)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The functions provided by <code>bc</code> are as follows (and can be found from <code>man bc</code>):</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>sqrt ( expression )\n       The value of the sqrt function is the square root of the expression.  \n       If the expression is negative, a run time error is generated.\n\ns (x)  The sine of x, x is in radians.\n\nc (x)  The cosine of x, x is in radians.\n\na (x)  The arctangent of x, arctangent returns radians.\n\nl (x)  The natural logarithm of x.\n\ne (x)  The exponential function of raising e to the value x.\n\nj (n,x)\n       The Bessel function of integer order n of x.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It also supports <code>if</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>while</code> and variables like a programming language though if it may be better to write to a file if you wanted that.</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that it will substitute <code>p</code> and <code>x</code> in function/variable names. It may be better to just remove the replacements.</p>\n\n<h2>Using gcalccmd</h2>\n\n<p>You can also make the function call <code>gcalccmd</code> (from <code>gnome-calculator</code>) like so:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-bsh prettyprint-override\"><code>=() {\n    calc=\"$@\"\n    # Uncomment the below for (p → +) and (x → *)\n    #calc=\"${calc//p/+}\"\n    #calc=\"${calc//x/*}\"\n    echo -ne \"$calc\\n quit\" | gcalccmd | sed 's:^&gt; ::g'\n}\n\n= 'sqrt(2)' # Returns 1.4142135623\n= '4^4'     # Returns 256\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The available functions seem to be (taken straight from <a href=\"http://sourcecodebrowser.com/gcalctool/5.29.2/mp-equation_8c.html#a2c1b83394ed2fe6da08e1538b65fd29b\">the source code</a>), <code>==</code> denotes equivalent functions:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-py prettyprint-override\"><code>ln()\nsqrt()\nabs()\nint()\nfrac()\nsin()\ncos()\ntan()\nsin⁻¹() == asin()\ncos⁻¹() == acos()\ntan⁻¹() == atan()\nsinh()\ncosh()\ntanh()\nsinh⁻¹() == asinh()\ncosh⁻¹() == acosh()\ntanh⁻¹() == atanh()\nones()\ntwos()\n</code></pre>\n",

It manages your ebook collection for you. It is designed around the concept of the logical book, i.e. a single entry in the database that may correspond to ebooks in several formats. It also upports conversion from a dozen different ebook formats to LRF and EPUB. A graphical interface to the conversion software can be accessed easily by just clicking the \"Convert E-books\" button.</p>\n\n<p>Supported input formats are: MOBI, AZW, LIT, PRC, EPUB, ODT, HTML, CBR, CBZ, RTF, TXT, PDF and LRS. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Starting calibre's ebook viewer as a standalone application</strong></p>\n\n<p>In certain cases you will not want to add an epub or mobi file to calibre's library before reading it. Luckily calibre's ebook viewer can be started independently via <code>ebook-viewer</code>.

            "answer": {
                "text": "<p>From the MAN PAGES:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shutdown</strong> - \"shutdown arranges for the system to be brought down in a safe way.  All\n       logged-in users are notified that the system is going down and,  within\n       the last five minutes of TIME, new logins are prevented.\" Time mentioned here is an amount specify by the user that is shutting down.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Halt</strong> - \"These programs allow a system administrator to reboot, halt or poweroff\n       the system.\"</p>\n\n<p>The difference is that Halt can be more \"aggressive\" when shutting down than Shutdown itself. It has parameters than can literally force the system to shutdown without regarding services or opened programs. If you run halt without any parameters it will simply execute the shutdown command. Something like an alias. If you run it for example with the parameter <code>--force</code> it will \"force\" the system into a reboot really fast.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of halt or shutdown, they will wait for all processes to finish correctly before turning the PC off or rebooting. If a service or app does not close or does not close properly you will see what you mention there (The ubuntu logo with the dots).</p>\n\n<p>The proper way in the terminal for a single user or multi user is shutdown. But if the shutdown is not working verify what services you have running and which one is causing the slowness or freezing of the shutdown.</p>\n\n<p>With that in mind, there are several ways to reboot or shutdown the system:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rebooting</strong> - <code>shutdown -r</code>, <code>reboot</code></p>\n\n<p>In this case, reboot is simply calling <code>shutdown -r</code>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shutting Down</strong> - <code>halt</code>, <code>shutdown</code>, <code>sudo init 0</code>, <code>shutdown -h now</code>, <code>poweroff</code></p>\n\n<p>In this case, <code>poweroff</code> is the same as calling <code>shutdown -P</code></p>\n\n<p>As you have noticed, The <code>shutdown</code> command can do a lot of stuff, here is a small list of it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-r  Requests that the system be rebooted after it has been brought down\n-h  Requests that the system be either halted or powered off after it has been brought down, with the choice as to which left up to the system\n-H  Requests that the system be halted after it has been brought down\n-P  Requests that the system be powered off after it has been brought down\n-c  Cancels a running shutdown. TIME is not specified with this option, the first argument is MESSAGE\n-k  Only send out the warning messages and disable logins, do not actually bring the system down\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As does the <code>reboot</code> </p>\n\n<pre><code>-f, --force                 force reboot or halt, don't call shutdown(8)\n-p, --poweroff              switch off the power when called as halt\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There is however a difference between shutdown down through the terminal and clicking on the Shutdown option in Unity. The latter will ask the user for interaction with any unsaved work (like libreoffice, inkscape...). the former will simply send a signal to all processes telling them to close. No user interaction will be needed so any unsaved work will be gone.</p>\n",

Note that it has a big bundle of dependencies. You can also go ahead and ask a question here on how to set a keyboard shortcut that doesn't depend on gnome running. </p>\n\n<p>There <em>is</em> a keyboard shortcut to shut down your system that is available all of the time, but it's rather tedious and complicated:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>SysRq</kbd>+(<kbd>R</kbd>, <kbd>E</kbd>, <kbd>I</kbd>, <kbd>S</kbd>, <kbd>U</kbd>, <kbd>O</kbd>).</p>\n\n<p>That is, hold down alt and sysrq, then type <code>REISUO</code>, or <code>REISUB</code> to reboot. The SysRq key is the Print Screen key on most keyboards (on some laptops, it's Fn +Print, or Alt+Fn+Print)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It's not a completely clean shutdown either (although it's good enough).
